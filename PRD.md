Product Requirements Document: A/B Testing Validation & Analysis APIAuthor: GeminiDate: June 18, 2025Version: 1.01. Introduction & VisionProduct Managers (PMs) live and die by the quality of their decisions. A/B testing is a cornerstone of data-driven decision-making, yet the process is fraught with friction. PMs often struggle with complex statistics, question the validity of their test setups, and spend hours translating raw data into actionable insights and stakeholder communications.This document outlines the requirements for a headless, general-purpose A/B Testing Validation & Analysis API. Its vision is to serve as an on-demand statistical consultant and strategic partner for Product Managers, empowering them to design sound experiments, interpret complex results with confidence, and build a rapid, cumulative learning loop. It aims to be the go-to utility for any PM who wants to move faster and make smarter, data-backed product bets.2. The ProblemProduct Managers face three primary challenges in the experimentation lifecycle:Pre-Test Uncertainty: Before committing engineering resources, PMs are often uncertain if their test is statistically sound. They ask: Is my sample size large enough? How long will this test take? Is my hypothesis clear? This leads to wasted cycles on tests that are doomed from the start.Post-Test Interpretation Paralysis: When a test concludes, especially with inconclusive or complex results, PMs struggle to move forward. They ask: The p-value is 0.08, what do I do? The overall result is flat, but one segment won. Now what? This leads to slow decision-making and lost momentum.The "So What?" Burden: A PM's job isn't just to get the data, but to build a narrative and a recommendation. Translating statistical outputs into a compelling story for executives, engineers, and other stakeholders is a manual, time-consuming process.3. Target AudiencePrimary Audience: The Product Manager (PM)Characteristics: Tech-savvy, data-literate but not a statistician, time-poor, and responsible for driving business outcomes (e.g., conversion, engagement, retention).Goals: To validate product hypotheses quickly, make confident ship/no-ship/iterate decisions, and effectively communicate the "why" behind their roadmap.4. Guiding PrinciplesThese principles will guide all design and development decisions:Educate, Don't Just Calculate: Make statistical concepts accessible through plain-English explanations. Help the user become a smarter experimenter.Consult, Don't Just Compute: Go beyond raw numbers to provide context, trade-offs, and actionable recommendations.Be Stateless & Unopinionated: Operate as a pure utility. Do not require data storage, user accounts, or adherence to a specific workflow. Be easy to integrate anywhere.Embrace Context: Acknowledge that quantitative data alone is insufficient. Blend user-provided qualitative context with statistical analysis to generate superior insights.5. Core Features & Requirements (Version 1.0)The initial version of the API will focus on the two highest-leverage, stateless utilities for pre- and post-experiment validation.5.1. Feature: Pre-Experiment "Feasibility Calculator"This feature allows a PM to get an instant sanity check on a proposed experiment's design and statistical feasibility.FR-1.1: Calculate Required Sample Size: The API must calculate the necessary sample size per variant based on baseline conversion rate, MDE, statistical power (1-β), and significance level (α).FR-1.2: Estimate Test Duration: Using the required sample size and an estimated daily traffic figure, the API must calculate the expected duration of the test.FR-1.3: Provide a Trade-off Matrix: The API MUST return a matrix showing how the estimated test duration changes with different Minimum Detectable Effects (MDEs), allowing the PM to understand the trade-off between speed and sensitivity.FR-1.4: Assess Hypothesis Clarity: The API should use an LLM to perform a qualitative check on the user's hypothesis for clarity and structure.FR-1.5: Support Absolute & Relative MDE: The API must accept the MDE as either a relative percentage (e.g., 10%) or an absolute value (e.g., 0.01).FR-1.6: Provide In-line Explanations: The API response MUST include simple, plain-English explanations for all statistical inputs and outputs to educate the user.5.2. Feature: Post-Experiment "Results Interpreter"This feature takes raw experiment data and transforms it into a rich analysis, complete with LLM-powered insights and actionable next steps.FR-2.1: Perform Statistical Calculation: The API must calculate the observed conversion rates, relative lift, p-value, and confidence interval for the primary variants.FR-2.2: Incorporate PM Context: The API MUST accept optional, qualitative notes from the PM about the experiment.FR-2.3: Generate an Interpretation Narrative (LLM): Using the statistical results and the PM's context, the API will generate a plain-English narrative explaining why the results likely occurred.FR-2.4: Recommend Next Steps (LLM): The API will generate a list of concrete, actionable next steps (e.g., "ITERATE & RE-TEST", "SHIP TO SEGMENT", "ABANDON HYPOTHESIS"), including a confidence score for each recommendation.FR-2.5: Generate Follow-up Questions (LLM): The API will suggest critical questions the PM should investigate next to deepen their understanding.FR-2.6: Analyze Segments: The API must be able to process and analyze segmented data if provided by the user, highlighting performance differences across user groups.6.

Error Handling: Respond with 400 Bad Request if results_data is malformed or contains insufficient data for calculation.7. Out of Scope (For Version 1.0)To ensure a focused and achievable initial release, the following will NOT be included in V1.0:A Graphical User Interface (UI): This is a headless API-only product.Data Persistence: The API will not store any experiment data, history, or user information. Every call is stateless.Authentication & User Accounts: The API will be open for its initial version.Real-time Monitoring: The API does not actively monitor running tests.Advanced Strategic APIs: The "Opportunity Analyzer" (/analyze/opportunity), "Stakeholder Report Generator" (/generate/report), and "Sequential Test Planner" (/plan/next-test) are slated for a potential V2 to build upon the core V1 functionality.8. AssumptionsThe user (PM) is responsible for providing accurate baseline and result data from their own analytics systems. The API will trust the inputs it is given.The user's A/B testing platform handles traffic splitting and variant assignment correctly. Our API is purely for pre- and post-test analysis.We have access to a reliable and powerful LLM API (e.g., via Google AI Platform) to power the generative analysis features.
