```

### Key Management Strategy
- **Secure Storage**: Chrome's encrypted storage API
- **Key Validation**: Real-time validation with friendly errors
- **Usage Tracking**: Show API usage to prevent bill surprises
- **Easy Rotation**: One-click key update
- **Fallback Mode**: Full statistical features without AI

## 📐 Ensuring Calculation Accuracy

### Multi-Layer Validation Approach
1. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Port Python tests to JavaScript first
   - Create test cases from real PM scenarios
   - Visual regression tests for UI calculations

2. **Cross-Validation System**
   ```javascript
   // During development: Compare with Python
   const jsResult = calculateSampleSize(params);
   const pythonResult = await fetchPythonCalculation(params);
   assert(Math.abs(jsResult - pythonResult) < 0.001);
   ```

3. **Statistical Libraries**
   - Use proven libraries: jStat, simple-statistics
   - Implement from first principles where needed
   - Open source calculations for peer review

4. **Trust Indicators**
   - Show calculation steps (collapsible)
   - Link to statistical methodology
   - "Verified ✓" badge for tested scenarios

## 💡 Providing Best-in-Class PM Insights

### Three-Tier Insight System

**Level 1: The Answer** (What every PM needs)
```
✅ Your experiment is statistically valid!
📊 You'll need 15,420 users per variant
⏱️ With your traffic, that's about 8 days
```

**Level 2: The Context** (Why it matters)
```
💡 Why this matters:
Your 10% MDE is aggressive but achievable. 
Most successful experiments see 5-15% lifts.
Consider testing with high-intent users first.
```

**Level 3: The Learning** (How to improve)
```
📚 Pro tip: Your hypothesis could be more specific.
Instead of: "Improve checkout conversion"
Try: "Reduce checkout steps from 3 to 2 will 
decrease abandonment by 15% for mobile users"
[Learn more about hypothesis writing →]
```

## 🎓 Educational Features for New PMs

### Integrated Learning Moments
1. **Contextual Micro-Lessons**
   - "What's MDE?" → 30-second visual explainer
   - "Why 80% power?" → Interactive slider demo
   - "Sample size math" → Progressive disclosure

2. **Good/Bad Examples**
   ```
   Your hypothesis: "Make button bigger"
   
   ⚠️ This hypothesis needs work. Here's why:
   ❌ No specific metric (clicks? conversions?)
   ❌ No expected impact (how much better?)
   ❌ No user segment (all users? mobile?)
   
   ✅ Better version:
   "Increasing CTA button size from 44px to 60px 
   will improve mobile checkout CTR by 15% for 
   first-time visitors"
   ```

3. **A/B Testing Maturity Journey**
   - Track experiments run
   - Unlock advanced features gradually
   - Celebrate milestones ("First significant result! 🎉")

## 🎨 Modern, Clutter-Free Design

### Design Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Show only what's needed at each step
   - Advanced options behind "Show more"
   - Smart defaults for everything

2. **Visual Hierarchy**
   ```
   PRIMARY ACTION    → Large, colored button
   Key Information   → Bold, prominent
   Supporting details → Smaller, gray
   Advanced options  → Collapsed by default
   ```

3. **Micro-Interactions**
   - Smooth transitions between states
   - Subtle animations for feedback
   - Loading states that educate

### Interface States

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Guide

### Core Statistical Functions to Port

1. **Sample Size Calculation**
   ```javascript
   function calculateSampleSize({
     baselineRate,
     mde,
     power = 0.8,
     significance = 0.05,
     isRelativeMDE = true
   }) {
     // Port from Python calculations.py
     // Ensure exact numerical match
   }
   ```

2. **Significance Testing**
   ```javascript
   function testSignificance({
     controlUsers,
     controlConversions,
     treatmentUsers,
     treatmentConversions
   }) {
     // Two-proportion z-test
     // Return p-value, confidence intervals
   }
   ```

### API Key Architecture
```javascript
// Secure storage pattern
class APIKeyManager {
  async saveKey(provider, key) {
    const encrypted = await this.encrypt(key);
    await chrome.storage.local.set({
      [`${provider}_api_key`]: encrypted
    });
  }
  
  async getKey(provider) {
    const stored = await chrome.storage.local.get(`${provider}_api_key`);
    return stored ? await this.decrypt(stored) : null;
  }
}
```

### LLM Integration Pattern
```javascript
class LLMClient {
  constructor(provider, apiKey) {
    this.provider = provider;
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
  }
  
  async analyzeHypothesis(hypothesis) {
    try {
      const response = await this.callAPI({
        prompt: HYPOTHESIS_ANALYSIS_PROMPT,
        input: hypothesis
      });
      return this.parseResponse(response);
    } catch (error) {
      return this.getFallbackAnalysis(hypothesis);
    }
  }
}
```
