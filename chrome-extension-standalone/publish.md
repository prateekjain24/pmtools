## Step 3: Permission Justifications

### Required Permissions and Their Justifications

#### 1. **storage**
```
This permission is required to save user preferences and data locally, including:
- API keys for AI services (encrypted)
- Form data for auto-save functionality
- User preferences (default power, significance level)
- Calculation history for easy access
All data is stored locally on the user's device and never transmitted to external servers.
```

#### 2. **notifications**
```
Used to alert users when:
- Long-running calculations complete
- AI analysis is ready
- Export operations finish
This ensures users can work in other tabs while waiting for results.
```

#### 3. **alarms**
```
Required for periodic maintenance tasks:
- Clearing expired model list cache (24-hour expiry)
- Auto-saving form data at intervals
- Managing temporary data cleanup
This helps maintain optimal extension performance.
```

#### 4. **host_permissions**
```
Required to communicate with AI services when users choose to enable AI insights:
- https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/* - For Google Gemini API
- https://api.anthropic.com/* - For Anthropic Claude API

These permissions are only used when users voluntarily provide their own API keys.
The extension works fully without these permissions for users who don't use AI features.
```
