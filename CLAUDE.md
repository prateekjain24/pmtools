# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PM Tools is a comprehensive A/B testing solution for Product Managers, consisting of two integrated components:

1. **FastAPI Backend** (`app/`) - Statistical calculations and LLM-powered analysis
2. **Chrome Extension** (`chrome-extension/`) - Browser-based UI for instant access

The project serves as a "statistical consultant in a box" providing:
- **Pre-Experiment Feasibility Calculator** - Validates experiment design before running tests
- **Post-Experiment Results Interpreter** - Analyzes results with AI-powered insights

### ðŸŽ¯ Standalone Chrome Extension (COMPLETED - December 2024)
The standalone Chrome extension is now fully implemented with:
- âœ… All statistical calculations running client-side in JavaScript
- âœ… BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model with dynamic model selection
- âœ… No server dependencies - works entirely in the browser
- âœ… Direct API calls to Gemini and Anthropic
- âœ… Enhanced statistical accuracy with proper formulas
- âœ… PM-focused AI prompts for actionable insights
- âœ… Real-time model discovery from API providers
- âœ… 24-hour caching for model lists
- âœ… Markdown to HTML conversion for LLM responses
- âœ… Structured JSON output for reliable LLM responses (June 2025)

## Memory

### Temporal Memories
- We are in June 2025

## Chrome Extension Features

### ðŸš€ Recent Updates (June 2025)

#### Enhanced Results Visibility
- **Fixed Auto-Scroll**: Results now properly scroll into view after calculations
- **Visual Notifications**: "ðŸ“Š Results ready below â†“" notification appears briefly
- **Attention Animation**: Results section highlighted with blue border and pulse effect
- **Form Collapse**: Forms automatically collapse after showing results to maximize space
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Added smooth scroll behavior throughout the extension
- **ID Mismatch Fix**: Corrected scrollToResults() to use proper element ID 'resultsSection'

#### Implementation Details
- Fixed ID mismatch in shared.js (was looking for 'results-section', now 'resultsSection')
- Added 150ms delay before scrolling to ensure DOM is fully rendered
- Implemented slideInFade/slideOutFade animations for notifications
- Added pulse animation for visual highlight effect
- Form collapse feature with toggle button for better space utilization

### Structured LLM Output (June 2025)
- **Problem**: LLM responses had broken markdown formatting (e.g., `**3/10**`, incomplete bold markers)
- **Solution**: Implemented Pydantic-style structured JSON output
- **Features**:
  - JSON schemas for hypothesis analysis and results interpretation
  - Direct HTML rendering from structured data (no regex parsing)
  - Support for both Gemini (JSON mode) and Anthropic
  - Professional UI with tables, colored indicators, and semantic sections
  - Backward compatibility with text-based parsing as fallback
- **Benefits**:
  - Eliminates markdown parsing errors completely
  - Type-safe responses with validation
  - Consistent formatting regardless of LLM quirks
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code

### Known Issues (Resolved)
- ~~**Results Hidden in Fold 2**: Results were not immediately visible after analysis~~ âœ… Fixed June 2025
- ~~**Auto-scroll Not Working**: ID mismatch prevented scrollToResults from functioning~~ âœ… Fixed June 2025
- ~~**Broken Markdown in LLM Responses**: Raw markdown like `**text**` showing incorrectly~~ âœ… Fixed June 2025 with structured output
