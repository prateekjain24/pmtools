# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PM Tools is a comprehensive A/B testing solution for Product Managers, consisting of two integrated components:

1. **FastAPI Backend** (`app/`) - Statistical calculations and LLM-powered analysis
2. **Chrome Extension** (`chrome-extension/`) - Browser-based UI for instant access

The project serves as a "statistical consultant in a box" providing:
- **Pre-Experiment Feasibility Calculator** - Validates experiment design before running tests
- **Post-Experiment Results Interpreter** - Analyzes results with AI-powered insights

### üéØ Standalone Chrome Extension (COMPLETED - December 2024)
The standalone Chrome extension is now fully implemented with:
- ‚úÖ All statistical calculations running client-side in JavaScript
- ‚úÖ BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model with dynamic model selection
- ‚úÖ No server dependencies - works entirely in the browser
- ‚úÖ Direct API calls to Gemini and Anthropic
- ‚úÖ Enhanced statistical accuracy with proper formulas
- ‚úÖ PM-focused AI prompts for actionable insights
- ‚úÖ Real-time model discovery from API providers
- ‚úÖ 24-hour caching for model lists
- ‚úÖ Markdown to HTML conversion for LLM responses
- ‚úÖ Structured JSON output for reliable LLM responses (June 2025)

#### Key Documentation Files
- `chrome-extension-standalone/README.md` - Technical implementation details
- `chrome-extension-standalone/IMPLEMENTATION_V2.md` - Standalone version architecture
- `chrome-extension-standalone/publish.md` - Chrome Web Store publishing guide (June 2025)

## Memory

### Temporal Memories
- We are in June 2025

## Chrome Extension Features

### üöÄ Recent Updates (June 2025)

#### Enhanced Results Visibility
- **Fixed Auto-Scroll**: Results now properly scroll into view after calculations
- **Visual Notifications**: "üìä Results ready below ‚Üì" notification appears briefly
- **Attention Animation**: Results section highlighted with blue border and pulse effect
- **Form Collapse**: Forms automatically collapse after showing results to maximize space
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Added smooth scroll behavior throughout the extension
- **ID Mismatch Fix**: Corrected scrollToResults() to use proper element ID 'resultsSection'

#### Implementation Details
- Fixed ID mismatch in shared.js (was looking for 'results-section', now 'resultsSection')
- Added 150ms delay before scrolling to ensure DOM is fully rendered
- Implemented slideInFade/slideOutFade animations for notifications
- Added pulse animation for visual highlight effect
- Form collapse feature with toggle button for better space utilization

### Structured LLM Output (June 2025)
- **Problem**: LLM responses had broken markdown formatting (e.g., `**3/10**`, incomplete bold markers)
- **Solution**: Implemented Pydantic-style structured JSON output
- **Features**:
  - JSON schemas for hypothesis analysis and results interpretation
  - Direct HTML rendering from structured data (no regex parsing)
  - Support for both Gemini (JSON mode) and Anthropic
  - Professional UI with tables, colored indicators, and semantic sections
  - Backward compatibility with text-based parsing as fallback
- **Benefits**:
  - Eliminates markdown parsing errors completely
  - Type-safe responses with validation
  - Consistent formatting regardless of LLM quirks
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code

### Modern Minimalist UI Redesign (June 2025)
- **Objective**: Transform the extension from a colorful, emoji-heavy interface to a sophisticated, minimalist design
- **Design Philosophy**: Black & white color scheme for timeless, professional appearance
- **Color Palette Changes**:
  - Primary color: #000000 (pure black)
  - Secondary color: #ffffff (pure white)
  - Accent colors: Various shades of gray (#f8f8f8, #e5e5e5, #999999, #666666, #333333)
  - Removed all blues, greens, reds, and purple gradients
- **Typography & Icons**:
  - Removed all emoji icons (üß™, üìä, ‚öôÔ∏è, etc.)
  - Replaced with clean text labels and minimal symbols (?, ‚Üë, ‚Üª)
  - Enhanced typography hierarchy using font weights instead of colors
- **Component Updates**:
  - **Headers**: White background with black text, removed gradient backgrounds
  - **Buttons**: Black background with white text, inverted on hover
  - **Forms**: Clean borders, subtle grayscale focus states
  - **AI Insights**: Removed purple gradient, now uses bordered design
  - **Status Indicators**: Replaced colored badges with black/white contrast
  - **Messages**: Monochromatic styling with border emphasis
- **Benefits**:
  - Professional, distraction-free interface
  - Better accessibility with maximum contrast
  - Timeless design that won't look dated
  - Focus on content and functionality over decoration
  - Consistent visual language throughout the extension
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Updated CSS variables in popup.css and options.css
  - Modified HTML files to remove emoji references
  - Maintained all existing functionality and calculations
  - Updated default LLM models to latest versions (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.0)
